# Hallo Wereld

That's `Hello World` in Dutch and with that I welcome you to my GitHub profile!

I started with VBS at 14 years old to create plugins for a certain chat bot. Then I moved to VB.NET, since I wanted ⚡ **UNLIMTED POWAA!!** ⚡... power, I mean power. But after a few years, then 16, I stepped over to C#.

I've done Vue, Angualar (which I prefer), PHP, read Java, C and C++. Even had a trip down momory lane with Perl, yes, the one with the camel.

❓ Currently rocking [Umbraco CMS](https://github.com/umbraco/Umbraco-CMS) with [Bootstrap](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap).
